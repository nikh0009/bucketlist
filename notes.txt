Things learned from express js crash course..

-Express is capable of serving satic resources.. example below!
-It can be used to build apis to return data to front end like react
-It can be used for templating.
I'm interested now only in building apis..

Serving static files using app.use(express.static())
Basically renders the ${endpoint}.html in the static folder
